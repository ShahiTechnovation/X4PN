# X4PN Production Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the strategic roadmap to transform the X4PN prototype into a production-ready, decentralized VPN ecosystem.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview: The "Three Pillars"

We will enforce a strict separation of concerns by treating the system as three distinct, interdependent sub-projects.

### 1. The Web Platform (`/platform`)
*   **Role**: The User Interface & Orchestrator.
*   **Components**: React Frontend (Dashboard), Express Backend (API/Indexer), PostgreSQL (Off-chain Cache).
*   **Responsibility**:
    *   User Authentication & Wallet Connection.
    *   Browsing & Filtering available VPN Nodes.
    *   Off-chain session coordination (signaling).
    *   Transaction history indexing from the blockchain.

### 2. The Node Daemon (`/node-daemon`)
*   **Role**: The Infrastructure Provider (The "Worker").
*   **Infrastructure**: Runs on **Dedicated VPS** (Ubuntu 22.04+).
*   **Technology**: Node.js/Go service wrapped in Docker.
*   **System Access**:
    *   Requires `root` privileges (handled via Docker `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN`).
    *   Manages `wg0` (WireGuard) network interfaces directly.
*   **Responsibility**:
    *   Auto-configuration of WireGuard keys.
    *   Real-time bandwidth tracking.
    *   Enforcing session limits (cutting access when payment stops).
    *   Heartbeat reporting to the Platform.

### 3. The Protocol (`/contracts`)
*   **Role**: The Trust Layer.
*   **Infrastructure**: EVM Blockchain (Polygon/BSC Mainnet).
*   **Responsibility**:
    *   Escrowing user funds (USDC).
    *   Streaming payments to Operator wallets.
    *   Minting X4PN rewards.
    *   Immutable registry of registered Node Operators.

## 🚀 Execution Phase 1: Containerization & Restructuring

We must decouple the current monolithic structure to support distributed deployment.

### 1.1 Dockerize the Web Platform
*   Create `platform/Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build for React client + Express server.
*   Create `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates Platform + PostgreSQL.
*   **Benefit**: Easy deployment to AWS/DigitalOcean for the central website.

### 1.2 Scaffold the Node Daemon
*   **New Project**: Create `node-daemon/`.
*   **Docker Strategy**:
    *   Use `lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard` or a custom Alpine base.
    *   Implement a Control Script (Node.js/Python) that watches for session requests and runs `wg` commands (`wg set`, `wg setconf`).
*   **VPS Script**: distinct `setup_node.sh` to install Docker, enable IP forwarding (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`), and run the container.

## ⚡ Execution Phase 2: System-Level Networking (WireGuard)

This is the most critical technical challenge. The Node Daemon needs to dynamically add/remove peers without restarting the interface.

### Strategy:
1.  **Dynamic Configuration**: The daemon will use the WireGuard command-line tools (`wg`) or a netlink library to add peers on the fly.
2.  **Auth Flow**:
    *   User requests session -> Platform API.
    *   Platform verifies funds -> Alerts Node Daemon (Websocket/Webhook).
    *   Node Daemon generates public key -> Sends to User.
    *   Node Daemon adds User Public Key to AllowedIPs.
    *   Node Daemon enables traffic.

## 🌐 Execution Phase 3: Production Blockchain Ops

Moving from Hardhat Local/Mumbai to Mainnet requires specific security measures.

### 3.1 Security & Deployment
*   **Private Key Management**: Never store keys in code. Use encrypted `.env` or Hardware Wallet signing for initial deployment.
*   **Verification**: Automated Etherscan/PolygonScan verification scripts in Hardhat.
*   **Multisig**: Transfer ownership of `X4PNToken` and `X4PNVpnSessions` to a Gnosis Safe (Multisig) wallet immediately after deployment.

### 3.2 Network Configuration
*   Update `hardhat.config.js` with high-reliability RPC endpoints (Alchemy/Infura) rather than public endpoints to ensure transaction reliability.

## 📋 Action Plan (Next Steps)

1.  **Refactor Directory Structure**: Move current `client`/`server` into `platform/`.
2.  **Create Node Daemon**: Initialize the specific project for VPS deployment.
3.  **Dockerize Everything**: Ensure `docker-compose up` brings up the local environment (Platform + DB), and a separate build command creates the VPS Node image.
