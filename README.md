# X4PN - Decentralized VPN & Reward Ecosystem

X4PN is a next-generation Decentralized VPN (dVPN) platform that revolutionizes internet privacy and connectivity. Built on blockchain technology, it allows users to pay for secure, high-speed VPN services using **USDC** and earn **X4PN tokens** as rewards for their usage.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Pay-as-you-go**: Micropayments streamed per second using USDC. No monthly subscriptions required.
*   **Earn to Surf**: Users earn **X4PN** tokens as rewards for every minute connected.
*   **Decentralized Infrastructure**: A global network of community-run nodes ensures censorship resistance and zero logs.
*   **Transparent & Trustless**: All transactions and session settlements are verified on-chain via Smart Contracts.
*   **Privacy First**: Built-in heavy encryption (WireGuard compatibility planned) and no central authority logging user data.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShahiTechnovation/X4PN.git
    cd X4PN
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from default or use the reference below):
    ```env
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/x4pn_vpn

    # Server
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Blockchain (Optional for local dev)
    POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
    ```

4.  **Database Migration**
    Push the schema to your local PostgreSQL instance:
    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

Start the development server (runs both Client and Server):

```bash
npm run dev
```

*   **Frontend**: http://localhost:5000
*   **API**: http://localhost:5000/api

## 🔗 Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are located in the `contracts/` directory.

*   **`X4PNToken.sol`**: The native reward token.
*   **`X4PNVpnSessions.sol`**: Handles session logic, payments, and settlements.

To compile and deploy contracts:
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
# Deploy script coming soon
```
