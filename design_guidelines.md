# X4PN VPN - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Hybrid**: Drawing inspiration from successful Web3 applications (Uniswap, MetaMask, Polygon) combined with modern dashboard patterns (Linear, Notion). This product requires both trust/credibility and functional clarity for handling blockchain payments and VPN sessions.

**Core Principle**: "Powerful simplicity" - complex blockchain operations presented through clean, confidence-inspiring interfaces.

Avoid: Scroll animations, parallax, excessive motion

## Design Principles

1. **Trust First**: Use established Web3 patterns for wallet interactions, clear transaction confirmations, visible security indicators
2. **Data Clarity**: Numbers are prominent, labels are clear, states are obvious
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as needed, simple by default
4. **Responsive Density**: Dense data displays on desktop, card-based stacking on mobile
5. **Blockchain Transparency**: Every action shows gas cost, confirmation states, transaction links
